-Q09nP62VnU,It is a pity that you have such a sick way of selection at the door. It is scandalous that such fascist and degrading criteria are used. Also very rude treatment of those waiting in line!
-Q09nP62VnU,Berlin forever needs Tresor
-Q09nP62VnU,"Dimitri is a real boss, all love and respect for this man."
-Q09nP62VnU,THX Dimitri for the amazing and very intensive years @ leipziger strasse!
-Q09nP62VnU,Names and relevance of those interviewed? Seems only Dimitri the founder was deserving of a title coming up on the screen.
-Q09nP62VnU,"Sogeil,danke für den Beitrag!!"
-Q09nP62VnU,"Clubs Like Omen, Tresor, Legoa Menen are legends in bringing great DJ Legends"
-Q09nP62VnU,"If you go to the legendary place, you know who left the sticker."
-Q09nP62VnU,😭😭😭😭😭
-Q09nP62VnU,🖤🙌🖤
-Q09nP62VnU,This city and tthe techno world owes so much to Tresor. A real treasure for all of us. Long live Tresor
-Q09nP62VnU,"track ID <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q09nP62VnU&amp;t=12m50s"">12:50</a> anyone? (:"
-Q09nP62VnU,need more video about this topic
-Q09nP62VnU,"FYI: it is presented as if the new tresor is in the large rooms that dimitri raves about. however, the club is in the basement and is not half as large."
-Q09nP62VnU,Boring AF =/
-Q09nP62VnU,"Lovely, but Resident Advisor fails to give the floor to female actors in the scene again. They made the documentary about Berlin (Real Scenes) more than 13 years ago and the problem is the same as it was there."
-Q09nP62VnU,"btw small typo in the music credits, Joey Baltram instead of Joey Beltram 🫶"
-Q09nP62VnU,"Had one of the best nights of my life at Tresor. It was like experiencing the purest techno scene in Berlin, raw concrete walls, metal bars, cold, slightly lightning, just the music doing its magic. Long live to this wonderful place! Thank you Dimitri!❤"
-Q09nP62VnU,"It sucks that pretty much the only thing Berlin has to offer is counter-culture and the city actively works to kick it out, so they have nothing to offer except yet another boring corporate desert."
-Q09nP62VnU,"That&#39;s a great story RA, albeit one told many times over during the last 10 years. I would say A for effort, the quality of the production is way up there.<br><br>On the other hand, why not use your media power in another responsible way by shining light on other relevant, contemporary survival stories. The last couple of years gave birth to interesting landscapes filled with inspiring characters, some of them even outside the widely-covered Berlin sphere.<br><br>Perhaps that&#39;s something that most of your audiences would be very interested in learning about. Modern day struggles of their peers. You know? The good, highly relatable stuff."
